# config_files
My personal configuration files to set up a Linux or Mac machine.

This repository contains:
- **``bashrc``** is my bash configuration file and should be linked or copied to ``~/.bashrc`` (or ``~/.bash_profile`` or other as appopriate for the system)
- **``vimrc``** is my vim configuration file and should be linked or copied to ``~/.vimrc``
- **``vim/``** is the rest of my vim configuration, containing syntax files and such, and should be linked or copied to ``~/.vim``
These three are applicable in Linux or Mac.  The next two are specific to Mac:
- **``mySmyck2.terminal``** is my terminal configuration file, which is a customized variant of the Smyck color scheme (https://github.com/hukl/Smyck-Color-Scheme/)
- **``new_terminal``** contains instructions and icons to construct a new item on the Dock that opens a new Terminal window (if Terminal is already open and you click the Dock icon, Mac will change to a Desktop that has an open Terminal window and set the focus on that window, instead of opening a new Terminal window in the current Desktop)
